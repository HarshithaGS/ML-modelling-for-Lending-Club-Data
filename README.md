  1. Our client Bipa is a portfolio manager. We have analyzed the client's needs and explored the statistics to present our insights for Bipa.
  2. Feature Engineering performed on dataset
  3. 3 ML models : Linear Regression , Random Forest , Neural Network implemneted and compared the efficiency using MAPE Analysis
  4. Hyper parameter tuning employed to optimize the models
  5. AutoML tools like H2o.ai and TPOT implemented. Also compared performanace with manual models.
  6. Test case ran on the model to predict the interest rate.
